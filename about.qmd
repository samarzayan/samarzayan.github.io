## Multipotentialite, Introvert, Philosophical

:wave: I am Samar, an aspiring data scientist.

:school: I have a background in education- I taught Math to high school kids and worked in various domains of the education sectors ranging from schools, NGOs and ed-tech platform doing all sorts of things beyond teaching. 

:robot: I am looking forward to transition into Data Science. I love the [fast.ai](fast.ai) course and am amazed by the powerful things it can do. I want to give it a shot and see where it takes me. I wish to build cool AI systems that can do wonderful stuff. That would be my dream job :heart_eyes:! 

:heart: I have a wide range of interests â€“ education, history, art, movies, books, music, philosophy, theology, and so on!
