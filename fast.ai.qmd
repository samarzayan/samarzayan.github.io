## fast.ai
Here I share all my learnings I gained from the [fast.ai](fast.ai) metaverse!

Be it from courses like [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) or from playlists like [Live Coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56sIyFjihEc&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM) or talks given by Jeremy Howard or Rachel Thomas and so on.

You get the idea!

## My Learning Goals
I hae set up the following targets for myself:

* Finish [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) by the end of 2022.
* Finish [From Deep Learning Foundations to Stable Diffusion](https://www.fast.ai/posts/part2-2022.html) by the first quarter of 2023.
