title: "-Uqq"

* `U` stands for an upgrade. It upgrades all specified packages to the newest available version.
* `q` stands for quiet. It hides certain messages and gives less output not polluting the coding environment with unnecessary outputs that occur during installation.
* When installing a package, a process of [logging](https://www.notion.so/Logging-1861ed2d068e4c0ca331a9018e809015) happens usually in 3 steps and at each step, the corresponding logging message gets displayed as an output. These are:
    1. WARNING messages
    2. ERROR messages
    3. CRITICAL messages
* The `q` is used to suppress these messages (outputs) in an additive fashion as follows:
    
```
-q:   hide WARNING messages
-qq:  hide WARNING and ERROR messages
-qqq: hide all messages
```
