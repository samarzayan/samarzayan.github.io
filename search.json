To avoid this does not happen, the tips shared in this lesson will be quite helpful.\nApart from all this, the lesson depicts the actual mechanics of setting up two environments, Google Colab and AWS EC2. This is what we will be using while actually coding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe coding environment is different in the 2022 version of the course.

The blog that Aman wrote was shared and highlighted by the CEO of Data61 which is a top Data Science body in Australia on LinkedIn.\nMost people prefer reading over watching a video and it can be helpful to them. You will learn and be useful at the same time.\n\n\n\nWhere to write?\nFollowing are some easy to get started on the blogging journey. There is no reason for us to not to start blogging. 1. Fastpages * One cool thing about this is that we can convert documents and notebooks into blogs easily. * It is in Github, so as we blog, we will learn about Git. * It uses Markdown, which will help us learn it as we blog 2. Google Sites If you feel intimidated with Git you can hop on to Google Sites. It has various themes we can use. 3. Medium If you still think that Google Sites is time-consuming to get started you can start away at medium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs of 2022, Quarto is a far better option than fastpages. This thread explains it in detail."

So as we progress with the course, whenever we learn to build a model, one key question to ask constantly is “How will this model generalize well?”.
