    "text": "I have a background in education- I taught Math to high school kids and worked in various domains of the education sectors ranging from schools, NGOs and ed-tech platform. Check out here to know more about my life as an educator.\nI loved my days as an educator but I wanted more in life. I went on to “discover” myself and find my inner voice (whatever that means :p). After experimenting with various stuff I finally decided I wanted to pursue Data Science. I wish to work in Applied AI & Research in my coming years.\nI consider myself a multipotentialite. I have high interest in the Liberal Arts education apart from Data Science. I personally believe that Humanities education brings about the innate nature of humans- to feel and sense.\nI want to enormous passions in writing, coding, and teaching. I am hiinterested in art, philosophy"
